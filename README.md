This repository is designed to be a tutorial for building very simple MCP servers.  It shows the underlying components of MCP servers (like python scripts) using a public API called [meowfacts](https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/meowfacts) by [wh-iterabb-it](https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/)

This server uses much of the same boilerlate used by the tutorial example on [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server#weather-api-issues) and shows how the tutorial can be easily leveraged to create other simple MCP servers.
